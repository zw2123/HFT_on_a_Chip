Side project, simplified version of HFT system, including FAST financial protocol; encoder/decoder; order book; and trading logic. This projects contains all the backbones of an HFT system.

Development process used Xilinx Design Suite (2023.2), C++ code is now ready for HLS, co-simulation and IP integration. Note: all components are of simplified version, but anyone is welcomed to use and build on this project to achieve more complex functionalities.

Please be aware: the project targets Alveo U50 Acceleration Card, before building the project, make sure you have added the board in  Vivado, here is how you can add a board, and here is how to get started wit Alveo U50.

Please move to the project folder before building and running:

Step 1: functional verification.
Step 2: HLS and co-simulation.
Step 3: IP generation and program the Alveo U50.
