Side project, simplified version of HFT system, including FAST financial protocol; encoder/decoder; order book; and threshold logic. The system can run with a latency with several 
hundreds of nanoseconds.

Development process used Xilinx Design Suite (2023.2), C++ code is now ready for HLS, co-simulation and IP integration.

Note: all components are of simplified version, but anyone is welcomed to use and build on this project to achieve more complex functionalities.

I will upload testbench when all bugs are removed.
